### As you can see, there is still some work left to do on my digital garden but here is a quick overview for now...

::: {#hero-heading}
## Experience

Currently, I am focusing on population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modelling of imatinib which is being studied for its repurposing potential in other disease indications including COVID-19 ARDS and PAH.

Previous modelling experiences include:

-   Development of a novel cardiovascular systems model to quantify drugs effects on the inter-relationship between contractility and other hemodynamic variables using pressure-volume loop theory

-   Development of a minimal hysiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model to predict pharmacokinetics and target disposition for recycling and sweeping antibodies

-   Statistical analysis (LASSO and Elastic net regression) of a high-dimensional set of metabolites in order to discover host-associated biomarkers for identification of pathogens in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) patients

## Teaching

Additionally, I am involved in teaching activities which include supervising students for their research internships, working together with instructors to include PKPD and PKPD modelling in their course curriculum as well as teaching/giving lectures.

Previous teaching experiences include:

-   BSc Pharmacokinetics & ADME course (2022, 2023)

-   Msc Pharmacokinetics & ADME course (2022, 2023)
